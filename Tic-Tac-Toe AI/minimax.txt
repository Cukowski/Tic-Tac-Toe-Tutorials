Minimax Algorithm - Short Summary
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games like Tic-Tac-Toe. It helps the AI choose the best move by simulating all possible future game states.

How it Works:

Recursion & Backtracking: The algorithm explores every possible move by recursively playing the game until a terminal state (win, loss, or draw) is reached.
Evaluation: Each state is assigned a score:
+10 if AI wins.
-10 if the player wins.
0 for a draw.

Minimizing & Maximizing:
The AI (Maximizer) picks the move with the highest score.
The Player (Minimizer) picks the move with the lowest score.

Optimal Move Selection: The AI evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that guarantees the best possible outcome, making it unbeatable.

ðŸ’¡ Key Idea: Minimax simulates all possible future game states and assumes both players play optimally. This makes the AI always choose the best move while avoiding losing positions.
